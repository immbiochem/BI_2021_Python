## Iterator assignment

The following objects have been implemented:
1) gen_fasta(path) - generator function, takes the path to the fast file as input and outputs sequence id pairs in turn

2) Class GeneratorRex - a class that reads sequences from the file with minor changes. 
If the file is over, then the iteration continues from its beginning. When returning each successive sequence, the class changes it slightly. The class contains the following methods:
   * replacement - replace one or more letters in the given sequence
   * delit - remove a letter or piece in the given sequence
   * inser - insert one or more letters into the given sequence
   * chance - apply replacement, delit or inser with some probability to the passed sequence

The folder also contains a .fasta file for testing and a Jupyter-notebook with a class demo.
